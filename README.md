## Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is Akiho Kawada (in Japanese 河田 顕帆).🐰

I’m currently an undergrad (4th year) at [Systems Innovation, Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo](https://www.si.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/).

My primary research interests are centered around hardware architecture (especially for AI/ML applications) and software-hardware co-design.

I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering / computer sciences at universities in the US or Europe after earning my bachelor’s degree.
